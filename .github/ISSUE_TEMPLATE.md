please check pinned issues first!

NOTE: deadsnakes only provides packages for ubuntu LTS releases (even number + .04)
- it's a lot of  **free** work already to build packages for LTS releases
- if you or your company would like to pay for this, please reach out directly
  (you can find my email address in my commits)
